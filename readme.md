# Skully PHP Framework

Skully Framework is a simple php framework you could use as a skeleton for any php project.

Skully project aims to teach its adapters best practices in PHP programming, and programming in general as adapters use it in their projects. We are a big fan of project [PHP The Right Way](http://phptherightway.com) so we built a framework around the concepts written there.

This framework uses [RedbeanPHP](http://redbeanphp.com) as its ORM and [Smarty](http://smarty.net) as its templating engine.

## What's So Good About Skully?

- We at Trio Digital Agency use Skully framework on all of our client projects, so you can expect a continuous development.
- One thing we particularly enjoy in using Skully is its separation of responsibilities: We can share a project's /public directory to our remote web developers and they can start doing their magic, while our in-house developers build its structure and back-end system.
- It is a compilation of best practices in software development.
- Easy to use command line tools (we use the symfony Command plugin for this), and additional tools you can add as you go. Examples below.
- Database migration, a great feature from Rails, is integrated with the help of Ruckusing module (which we tinkered with a bit).
- We think this is the best feature Skully offers: Clean integration with our favourite IDE: [PHP Storm]()
